	We will be implementing a Turn-Based Fighter (like Pokemon) game. 
Upon arrival to the site the player will be allowed to make a game or 
join an existing game. They will then be brought to a screen that allows 
them to create a "creature" or select a pre-made creature. 
	The creation process will be selecting colors and shapes to add to
the creature. A couple of buttons on the side of the screen with current
creation in the center should suffice. The creatures stats will be decided
by the components and colors making up the creature. For now the stats 
distribution and how they will work have not been decided. Right now 
we only have Health (HP) and Mana(MP) planned.
	They will then be given a chance to bring a couple of items with 
them the number is undecided but we are looking at at least three items. 
Then they will be transferred to a screen where they will face their 
opponents creature. Then starts the turn based fighting like classic 
Pokemon on the gameboy. They will be allowed to take three kinds of 
actions on the battle screen. They get to use one of four random moves 
(battle action) which will cost MP. The battle actions will be a one 
time use and toss. Each turn the move they used last turn is discarded. 
A new one is randomly assigned. A regular attack is another action and 
so is using an item (item action). The winning player is the player who 
successfully puts their opponents creature's health to zero. Or if their 
opponent surrenders or quits the game. For this purpose a player is allowed 
5 minutes(subject to change) to reconnect if the disconnect was unintentional.
Some aspects of this game will probably change later on.
